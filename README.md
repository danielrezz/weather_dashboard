    Challenges

<p>
    This project was just about as challenging as they come for me. It was my first time accessing info through APIs, but once I understood how to do that and dynamically create elements, it flowed really well. Another challenge was getting the localStorage information. I was able to set the info, but getting it to re-populate upon a reload is still a work in progress.
